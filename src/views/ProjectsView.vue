            Putting in over 8 years of work means I <em>must</em> have done at
            least one thing to show-off. Turns out I do. Here's a shortlist of
            things that I'm proud off.

              MarkeyDS is a project that I hold close to my heart. I didn't
              start the project, but I have taken the lead on it over the last 5
              years. This is a project that started without using a framework. I
              know right! It's silly to think now that that could ever be an
              option. Luckily, when I took over the conversion for the backend
              ws being put in place to use the
              <code-pill sm>Fatfree Framework</code-pill>
              . Unfortunately for me, the conversion wasn't complete and it fell
              onto me. So after a whole bunch of solid coding sessions I was
              able finish what others had started. Then a few years later we
              decided to get really crazy and put the frontend into
              <code-pill sm>Vue.js</code-pill>. This was an incredibly
              challenging task that required a lot of thought of how to unwrap
              the tightly coupled frontend logic to make it more componentized.
              The conversion is ongoing, but it's in a really good spot where we
              can continue to add new features.

              Rummage City has been in (once-in-awhile) development for 10
              years. This is a project that I started to do because I instantly
              fell in love with coding, but needed a purposeful project to keep
              learning about building websites. After many, many iterations and
              starting from scratch, this is where we are at with it now.

              Back in the day before TiVo was "smart" and we had to create
              things by hand, TiVo didn't have a smart assistant companion. So,
              being a developer and nerdy enough to want to be able to talk to
              my TiVo instead of having to find the remote, I created one.
